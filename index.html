          The <span id="mainText">Cassini</span> spacecraft orbited Saturn from June 30, 2004, until Sept. 15, 2017, when the probe ended its life with a plunge into the ringed planet's atmosphere.
          This intentional death dive was performed to make sure Cassini never contaminated a potentially habitable Saturn moon, such as Enceladus or Titan.
          <br>The mission is known for discoveries such as finding jets of water erupting from Enceladus, and tracking down a few new moons for Saturn.
          <span id="mainText">Cassini</span> is a joint project among several space agencies, which is a contrast from the large NASA probes of the past such as Pioneer and Voyager. In this case, the main participants are NASA, the European Space Agency and Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (the Italian space agency).
          Cassini was the first dedicated spacecraft to look at Saturn and its system. It was named for Giovanni Cassini, a 17th-century astronomer who was the first to observe four of Saturn's moons — Iapetus (1671), Rhea (1672), Tethys (1684) and Dione (1684).
          <br>Before this spacecraft came several flybys of Saturn by Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981). Some of the discoveries that came out of these missions included finding out that Titan's surface can't be seen in visible wavelengths (due to its thick atmosphere), and spotting several rings of Saturn that were not visible with ground-based telescopes.
        <div id="img-box">
          <img src="cassini.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
        It was shortly after the last flyby, in 
          <span id="mainText">1982</span>, that scientific committees in both the United States and Europe formed a working group to discuss possible future collaborations. The group suggested a flagship mission that would orbit Saturn, and would send an atmospheric probe into Titan. However, there was a difficult "fiscal climate" in the early 1980s, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory noted in a brief history of the mission, which pushed approval of Cassini to 1989.
        Cassini's development came with at least two major challenges to proceeding. By 1993 and 1994, the mission had a $3.3 billion price tag (roughly $5 billion in 2017 dollars, or about half the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope.) Some critics perceived this as overly high for the mission. In response, NASA pointed out that the European Space Agency was also contributing funds, and added that the technologies from Cassini were helping to fund lower-cost NASA missions such as the Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Pathfinder and the Spitzer Space Telescope, according to JPL.
        Cassini also received flak from environmental groups who were concerned that when the spacecraft flew by Earth, its radioisotope thermoelectric generator (nuclear power) could pose a threat to our planet, JPL added. These groups filed a legal challenge in Hawaii shortly before launch in 1997, but the challenge was rejected by the federal district court in Hawaii and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
        Cassini didn't head straight to Saturn. Rather, its mission involved complicated orbital mechanics. It went past several planets — including Venus (twice), Earth and Jupiter — to get a speed boost by taking advantage of each planet's gravity.
        <br> The nearly 12,600-lb. (about 5,700 kilograms) spacecraft was hefted off Earth on Oct. 15, 1997. It went by Venus in April 1998 and June 1999, Earth in August 1999 and Jupiter in December 2000.
        Cassini settled into orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004. Among its prime objectives were to look for more moons, to figure out what caused Saturn's rings and the colors in the rings, and understanding more about the planet's moons.
        Perhaps 
          <span id="mainText">Cassini's</span> most detailed look came after releasing the Huygens lander toward Titan, Saturn's largest moon. The lander was named for Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, who in 1654 turned a telescope toward Saturn and observed that its odd blob-like shape — Galileo Galilei had first seen the shape in a telescope and drew it in his notebook as something like ears on the planet — was in fact caused by rings.
        The Huygens lander descended through the mysterious haze surrounding the moon and landed on Jan. 14, 2005. It beamed information back to Earth for nearly 2.5 hours during its descent, and then continued to relay what it was seeing from the surface for 1 hour 12 minutes.
        <div id="img-box">
          <img src="cassini_2.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
        In that brief window of time, researchers saw pictures of a rock field and got information back about the moon's wind and gases on the atmosphere and the surface.
        One of the defining features of Saturn is its number of moons. Excluding the trillions of tons of little rocks that make up its rings, Saturn has 62 discovered moons as of September 2012. NASA lists 53 named moons on one of its websites.
        In fact, Cassini discovered two new moons almost immediately after arriving (Methone and Pallene) and before 2004 had ended, it detected Polydeuces.
        <div id="img-box">
          <img src="cassini_3.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
          Saturn has not gone ignored, either. For example, in 2012, a NASA study postulated that Saturn's jet streams in the atmosphere may be powered by internal heat, instead of energy from the sun. Scientists believe that heat brings up water vapor from the inside of the planet, which condenses as it rises and produces heat. That heat is believed to be behind jet stream formation, as well as that of storms.
        Cassini was originally slated to last four years at Saturn, until 2008, but its mission has been extended multiple times. Its last and final leg was called the Cassini Solstice Mission, named because the planet and its moons reached the solstice again toward the mission end. Saturn orbits the sun every 29 Earth-years. With Cassini's mission lasting 13 years, this meant that the spacecraft observed almost half of Saturn's seasonal change as the planet went around its orbit.
        In 2016, the spacecraft was set on a series of final maneuvers to provide close-up views of the rings, with the ultimate goal of plunging Cassini into Saturn on Sept. 15, 2017. This strategy was designed to protect Enceladus and other potentially habitable moons from the (small) chance of Cassini colliding with the surface, spreading Earth microbes.

        As a comet travels close to the Sun, it heats up and part of the comet vaporizes. After a comet has orbited the Sun many times, a lot of small pieces of the comet are left along the comet's path. A meteor shower happens when Earth passes through the path of a comet. When this happens, the bits of comet debris, most no larger than a grain of sand, create streaks of light in the night sky as they burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Bits of debris which enter Earth's atmosphere are called meteors. On any night, there are several small meteors which shoot across the sky. However, during a meteor shower, tens to hundreds of meteors can be seen each hour. Many of these meteor showers can be predicted and occur at the same time each year.
      </p>

        <img src="meteor-shower_1.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky called Radiant. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. The Meteor Data Center of the IAU lists over 900 suspected meteor showers of which about 100 are well established.

      <p>
        Comets are celestial bodies that originate from the outer regions of the solar system and are composed of a mixture of ice, dust, and rocky material. They are often described as "dirty snowballs" because of their icy nature combined with embedded dust particles. Comets are believed to be remnants from the early stages of the solar system's formation around 4.6 billion years ago.
        <br>
        On the other hand, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast, spherical region enveloping the solar system, much farther away than the Kuiper Belt. It is thought to contain a massive reservoir of comets that remain in long, elliptical orbits around the Sun. These comets are known as long-period comets, and they can take hundreds or even thousands of years to complete one orbit around the Sun.
        <br>
        When comets approach the inner solar system, they start to be influenced by the Sun's radiation and solar wind. As they get closer to the Sun, solar radiation heats up the comet's nucleus, causing the ices in the nucleus to sublimate (directly transition from a solid to a gas) and the dust to vaporize. This process creates a glowing envelope around the nucleus known as the coma, which can extend for thousands to millions of kilometers in size.
        <br>
        The appearance of comets can vary greatly depending on their distance from the Sun and their size. Some comets remain dim and faint, only visible through telescopes or space probes, while others become spectacular enough to be seen with the naked eye from Earth. Comets are often discovered by astronomers when they brighten as they approach the Sun, and their tails become more prominent.
        </p>
      <div id="img-box">
        <img src="comets_2.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        As the comet continues its journey, the solar wind (a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun) pushes the ionized gases in the coma away from the Sun, forming a straight, bluish-hued ion tail. At the same time, the dust particles in the coma, much heavier than the gases, are pushed away from the Sun by radiation pressure, creating a wider, curved dust tail that trails behind the comet's orbital path.
      <br>
      In terms of their composition, comets contain a wide range of volatile compounds, including water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and more. The specific composition can vary from comet to comet, and studying this composition provides valuable insights into the early solar system's chemistry and conditions.
      </p>
     <div id="img-box">
       <img src="comets_3.jpg" alt="">
     </div>
     <p>
       Overall, comets are fascinating objects that offer a glimpse into the history and formation of our solar system. Their appearance, behavior, and composition continue to intrigue astronomers and space enthusiasts, making them a subject of ongoing scientific research and public fascination.

        Nebulae and star clusters are fascinating cosmic phenomena found throughout our vast universe. Nebulae are enormous clouds of gas and dust, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with trace elements, scattered across the interstellar space. These celestial regions serve as the birthplaces of stars and planetary systems, as gravity pulls these materials together, triggering the formation of new stellar objects.
      </p>
      <div id="img-box">
        <img src="nebulae_2.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
       Star clusters, on the other hand, are groups of stars that share a common origin and gravitational bond. They come in two primary types: open clusters and globular clusters. Open clusters are relatively young and contain hundreds to thousands of stars, loosely bound together. These clusters are often found in the spiral arms of galaxies like our Milky Way. Globular clusters, on the other hand, are densely packed, spherical collections of stars numbering from thousands to millions, and they tend to be much older, typically orbiting in the galactic halos. 
        <br>
        The diversity of nebulae is truly astounding. There are emission nebulae, like the famous Orion Nebula, which shine brightly due to the ionization of surrounding gas by newborn stars. Additionally, there are reflection nebulae, such as the Pleiades, which scatter the light of nearby stars and create beautiful blue hues. Supernova remnants are another type of nebula formed from the explosive death of massive stars, dispersing their elements into space, enriching the cosmos with heavy elements like iron and gold.
        </p>
     <div id="img-box">
       <img src="nebulae_3.jpg" alt="">
     </div>
     <p>
       Star clusters and nebulae play a crucial role in the life cycle of stars and galaxies. Nebulae provide the raw materials from which stars form, while star clusters act as stellar nurseries, shaping the evolution of stars over time. These cosmic structures also offer valuable insights into the processes of stellar birth, evolution, and death, helping astronomers understand the complexities of our universe and its ongoing expansion.
     </p>
     <div id="img-box">
       <img src="nebulae_4.jpg" alt="">
     </div>
     <p>
       As we continue to explore the cosmos through advanced telescopes and space missions, we are sure to uncover more about the fascinating nature of nebulae and star clusters, shedding light on the fundamental workings of the universe and our place within it.
     </p>
     <div id="img-box">
       <img src="nebulae_5.jpg" alt="">
     </div>
     <p>
       Nebulae and star clusters are not only crucial in shaping the cosmos, but they also hold some of the most breathtaking and captivating sights in the night sky. One of the most iconic nebulae is the Eagle Nebula, famously known for the "Pillars of Creation" - towering columns of gas and dust where new stars are being born. This awe-inspiring image, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, has become a symbol of the cosmos' beauty and wonder.
     </p>
     <div id="img-box">
       <img src="nebulae_6.jpg" alt="">
     </div>
     <p>
       Star clusters also come in various intriguing forms. Some of the most visually stunning open clusters, like the Pleiades and the Beehive Cluster (M44), can be observed with the naked eye. Their bright stars create sparkling patterns against the dark backdrop of space, captivating stargazers throughout history. In contrast, globular clusters are tightly packed, almost resembling a swarm of bees. Their dense cores are composed of ancient stars, some of which are almost as old as the universe itself.
     </p>
     <div id="img-box">
       <img src="nebulae_7.jpg" alt="">
     </div>
     <p>
     Moreover, nebulae and star clusters are not just passive objects in space; they can interact dynamically with one another. For instance, a massive star in a star cluster can create shockwaves and powerful stellar winds that shape the surrounding nebula, compressing the gas and initiating new star formation. These intricate processes reveal the interconnectedness of celestial objects, showing that the cosmos is a living, evolving entity.
